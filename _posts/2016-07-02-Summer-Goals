Hey hi hello I'm back

So this summer I have had the INCREDIBLE opportunity to manage the social media for Plato's Closet at Southpoint in Durham, NC. I am so incredibly happy with the work my team has done to boost our social media presence. You can view the Instagram [here] (https://www.instagram.com/platosindurham_/). 

On top of this, I've been trying to stay busy exploring Chapel Hill and Carrboro! There are so many fun things to do, and recently I went to Mapleview Farm for the first time. Let me tell ya-- all the rumors are true. It's incredible.

So far living in Chapel Hill over the summer has been nothing short of incredible. It's hard to have a rough day in Blue Heaven!
