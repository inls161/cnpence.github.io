## Holy crap y'all.

I finally thank GOD did it. I had to completely delete my original website and start from scratch, but I did it. Guess that's what I get for making too many changes without saving!

Now that I'm not biting off more than I can chew, hopegfully this edition of Carson Land goes better. Stay tuned!
